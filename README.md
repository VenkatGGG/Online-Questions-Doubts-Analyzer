# Online-Questions/Doubts-Analyzer
This will ease the answering of questions and clearing the doubts of audience asked by the majority of the audience in online meets and gatherings
When there are more audience in online meetings and sessions,it is very hard for the host to clear the doubts asked by the audience in the given time.
In order to overcome that I came up with a solution of arranging the questions with most asked keywords at the top so that the host can answer it more conviniently.
At the end of the meeting the questions are ordered in such a way that the questions(keywords) asked by majority of the students comes at the top.
Thus, host can re-explain or answer it.
It also helps the host in which topic he must concentrate or to push more int the comming lectures/sessions
